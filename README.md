# GabriellaPortfolioChallenge
Am going to submit my portfolio to showcase my career since highschool

programming languages to use HTML, CSS, and MySQL
my idea is to store my CV details in a database and retrieve them to my website. Now let me use the SDLC
Wednesday 26th March 2025
                1. Planning 
                
Instructed Tech Stack: Strictly HTML5 + CSS
My method:
The HTML will be for my web page’s structure
The CSS will add style to it
Database for what? I shall put my cv details into my database as a BLOB
My database to store my information will consist of several tables:
1.	Personal_Info – Stores your personal details.
2.	Education – Contains your academic background.
3.	Work_Experience – Lists your job history.
4.	Skills – Stores your skills.
5.	Referees – Contains details of your referees.

My project folder consists of:

PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge/GabriellaNWekesaPortfolio/
│── cv_files/                   this contains my original CV file
│── database/                   this stored my SQLite database file
│── downloads/                  this is to store my downloaded CVs
│── style.cs                      
│── images                      this is to store images used in the projec
│── index.html
│── educational_background.html
│── upload_cv.py                this contains Python scripts for backend 
│── download_cv.py              this contains Python scripts for backend 
│── README.md                 		this is for my documentation optional

                   2. Design
I decied on HTML and subsequent CSS that would ensure a clean layout for readability and user-friendliness.

                3. Development
i made the html and css pages
i used sqlite to allow me to create a database on cmd instead of using workbench. This allowed me to create a database in a folder that is in my project folder and make tables in it    

                4. Testing
   i had done the html pages, css, and python scripts in a folder called GabriellaNWekesaPortfolio so when cloning i decied to clone in it so now my new file structure looks like this
  PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge/GabriellaNWekesaPortfolio/GabriellaPortfolioChallenge/
│── cv_files/                   this contains my original CV file
│── database/                   this stored my SQLite database file
│── downloads/                  this is to store my downloaded CVs
│── images                      this is to store images used in the projec
│── style.css
│── contact.html   
│── educational_background.html                  
│── index.html
│── interests.html
│── programminglanguages.html
│── projects.html
│── README.md                 		this is for my documentation
│── upload_cv.py                this contains Python scripts for backend 
│── download_cv.py              this contains Python scripts for backend 

 i tested to see :
correct display and styling.
Verified that the CV download button works properly.
Ensured all links, images, and text were displayed correctly.
Tested responsiveness to see how the pages look on different screen sizes.
                4. Deployment
My pages are currently in my laptop's local development stage.
Next I want to deploy them online using GitHub Pages
